*Test results are for the code in this repository as it appeared on November 25 at 17:15 CT.*

+ Pass: Change into directory "Hwk_06".

+ Pass: Check that file "streams.ml" exists.

Note: the following definition of `drop` is used by the automated tests:

```ocaml
let rec drop (n: int) (xs: 'a list) : 'a list =
  if n <= 0 || xs = [] then xs else drop (n-1) (List.tl xs)

```
