=toInt (add (Succ n) (sumTo' n))
by def of sumTo'

=toInt (Succ n) + toInt (sumTo' n)
by previous property

= toInt (Succ n) + (0 + 1 +2 + .. + (toInt n))
  by inductive hyp.

= 0 + 1 + 2 + ... + (toInt n) + toInt (Succ n)
  by arithmetic

= 0 + 1+ 2 + ... + (toInt (Succ n))
  by toInt n is one less than toInt Succ n
