```
let cond c t e = if c then t else e

sum (take 3 (squares_from 1))

where

sum [] = 0
sum x::xs = x + sum xs

take 0 lst = 0
take n [] = []
take n(x::xs) = x::take (n-1) xs

squares_from v = v*v :: squares_from (v+1)

so:

sum (take 3 (squares_from 1))
sum (take 3 (1*1:: squares_from (1+1)))
sum (take 2 (2*2::1::squares_from (2+1)))
sum (take 1 (3*3::4::1::squares_from (3+1)))
sum (16::9::4::1)
```
