(* Simple translator for Quiz 4.

(* The type for values in our imperative language. *)
type value
  = Int of int
  | Bool of bool

(* The type for expressions, which are similar to those seen before. *)
type expr =
  | Val of value
  | Id  of string
  | Add of expr * expr
  | Mul of expr * expr
  | Sub of expr * expr
  | Div of expr * expr
  | Mod of expr * expr
  | Lt  of expr * expr
  | Lte  of expr * expr
  | Eq  of expr * expr
  | Not of expr
  | And of expr * expr

(* A statement has the expected forms from imperative programming. *)
type stmt =
  | Skip
  | Assign of string * expr
  | Seq of stmt * stmt
  | ReadNum of string
  | WriteNum of expr
  | WriteStr of string
  | IfThenElse of expr * stmt * stmt
  | While of expr * stmt

  | IfThen of expr * stmt
  | For of string * expr * expr * stmt

(* A program has a name, list of variables, and a statement. *)
type prog = string * string list * stmt


(* A translator to OCaml *)

(* All generated OCaml programs have the same first few lines that define
   a `read_number` function.  Those lines are stored in this `header`
   string.
 *)

  "      print_endline \"Please, enter an integer value: \"; \n" ^
  "      read_number () \n" ^
  "in \n\n"

(* Your translator will need to write the translation of a program
   out to a file.  This file does that by writing `contents` into
   a file named `name`.
 *)
